    "query": "Build a multi-touch attribution model in Customer Journey Analytics that combines Adobe Analytics web data with offline conversion events from AEP. The model needs to account for cross-device journeys, assisted conversions from email campaigns, and phone call conversions tracked via call tracking integration. Explain the workspace setup, calculated metrics, and how to handle attribution for subscription vs. one-time purchase business models.",
    "gemini_response": "Based on the provided documentation, we can outline the steps to build a multi-touch attribution model in Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), but the documentation is limited and doesn't provide specific details on *how* to implement each step. It mainly highlights the *capability* of CJA to perform cross-channel attribution. Therefore, the following is a high-level approach based on the information available and general knowledge of attribution modeling:\n\n**High-Level Approach:**\n\nThe documentation emphasizes the ability of CJA to connect online and offline data based on a common customer ID, enabling attribution across the entire customer data set.  The key is leveraging the power of Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) to unify the data and then using CJA's visualization capabilities to analyze attribution.\n\n**1. Data Integration and Preparation (via Adobe Experience Platform - AEP):**\n\n*   **Unify Data in AEP:** This is the foundation.  You need to ingest and unify your data from various sources into AEP using a common customer ID (e.g., CRM ID, hashed email address). This includes:\n    *   **Adobe Analytics Web Data:**  This provides the online behavior data (page views, clicks, etc.).\n    *   **Offline Conversion Events:**  Data from your CRM or other systems containing offline purchase information.\n    *   **Email Campaign Data:**  Data from your email marketing platform (e.g., Adobe Campaign, Marketo) including email sends, opens, and clicks.  Crucially, this data needs to be linked to the common customer ID.\n    *   **Call Tracking Data:**  Integrate your call tracking system with AEP.  This will allow you to associate phone calls with specific customers and potentially even link them back to previous online or email interactions.\n*   **Schema Definition:**  Define a unified schema in AEP that encompasses all the data points you need for attribution.  This schema should include fields for:\n    *   Customer ID\n    *   Timestamp\n    *   Channel (e.g., Web, Email, Phone)\n    *   Touchpoint (e.g., Page URL, Email Subject Line, Phone Number)\n    *   Conversion Event (e.g., Purchase, Subscription Start)\n    *   Revenue (if applicable)\n*   **Data Mapping and Transformation:**  Map the data from each source to the unified schema.  This may involve data transformation to ensure consistency.\n\n**2. Workspace Setup in Customer Journey Analytics:**\n\n*   **Connect to AEP:**  Connect your CJA workspace to the AEP dataset containing the unified customer data.\n*   **Define Dimensions:**  Create dimensions in CJA based on the fields in your AEP schema.  Key dimensions will include:\n    *   Customer ID\n    *   Channel\n    *   Touchpoint\n    *   Date/Time\n*   **Define Metrics:**  Create metrics in CJA to measure key performance indicators (KPIs).  Examples include:\n    *   Visits\n    *   Conversions\n    *   Revenue\n    *   Assisted Conversions (see calculated metrics below)\n\n**3. Calculated Metrics for Attribution:**\n\n*   **First Touch Conversions:**  A metric that counts conversions where a specific channel or touchpoint was the first interaction in the customer journey.\n*   **Last Touch Conversions:**  A metric that counts conversions where a specific channel or touchpoint was the last interaction before the conversion.\n*   **Linear Attribution:**  A metric that distributes conversion credit equally across all touchpoints in the customer journey.  This requires a calculated metric that divides the total conversion value by the number of touchpoints.\n*   **Time Decay Attribution:**  A metric that gives more credit to touchpoints that occurred closer to the conversion.  This requires a more complex calculated metric that assigns weights based on the time elapsed between the touchpoint and the conversion.\n*   **U-Shaped (Position-Based) Attribution:**  A metric that gives more credit to the first and last touchpoints, with the remaining credit distributed among the other touchpoints.\n*   **Custom Attribution Models:** CJA allows for custom attribution models.  You can define your own rules for assigning credit based on your specific business needs.\n\n**4. Visualizations and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Attribution Panel:**  Use the attribution panel in CJA to visualize the contribution of different channels and touchpoints to conversions.  Experiment with different attribution models to see how they impact the results.\n*   **Flow Diagrams:**  Use flow diagrams to visualize the customer journey across channels.  This can help you identify key touchpoints and understand how customers move between channels.\n*   **Cohort Analysis:**  Use cohort analysis to compare the performance of different customer segments based on their initial touchpoints.\n*   **Contribution Analysis:** Use contribution analysis to identify the factors that are most strongly correlated with conversions.\n\n**5. Handling Specific Scenarios:**\n\n*   **Cross-Device Journeys:**  The unified customer ID in AEP is crucial for tracking customers across devices.  Ensure that you are capturing the customer ID on all devices and associating it with their interactions.\n*   **Assisted Conversions from Email Campaigns:**  Track email opens and clicks and associate them with the customer ID.  Use attribution models that give credit to assisted conversions (e.g., U-shaped, time decay).  Create a calculated metric specifically for email-assisted conversions.\n*   **Phone Call Conversions:**  Integrate your call tracking system with AEP and associate phone calls with the customer ID.  This will allow you to include phone calls in your attribution models.\n\n**6. Subscription vs. One-Time Purchase Business Models:**\n\n*   **Subscription:**  For subscription models, focus on metrics like customer lifetime value (CLTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC).  Attribution should consider the long-term value of a customer, not just the initial purchase.  Track the channels and touchpoints that lead to subscription renewals and upgrades.\n*   **One-Time Purchase:**  For one-time purchases, focus on metrics like conversion rate and average order value.  Attribution should focus on the channels and touchpoints that directly lead to the purchase.\n\n**Important Considerations (Based on General Knowledge):**\n\n*   **Data Quality:**  Accurate and consistent data is essential for effective attribution.  Invest in data quality processes to ensure that your data is reliable.\n*   **Attribution Model Selection:**  There is no one-size-fits-all attribution model.  The best model for your business will depend on your specific goals and data.  Experiment with different models and compare the results.\n*   **Testing and Optimization:**  Continuously test and optimize your attribution models to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.\n*   **Incrementality Testing:**  Consider using incrementality testing (e.g., holdout groups) to measure the true impact of your marketing efforts.  Attribution models can provide valuable insights, but they are not a substitute for rigorous testing.\n\n**Limitations of the Documentation:**\n\nThe provided documentation is very high-level and lacks specific instructions on how to implement these steps within CJA.  It primarily serves as an overview of the capabilities of the platform.  To get detailed instructions, you would need to consult the full CJA documentation and potentially work with Adobe consultants.\n\nIn summary, building a multi-touch attribution model in CJA requires a solid foundation of unified data in AEP, careful workspace setup, and the creation of appropriate calculated metrics. The documentation highlights the *possibility* of doing this, but the *how* requires deeper exploration of the CJA and AEP platforms.\n",
