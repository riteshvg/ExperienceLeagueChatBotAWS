# üèóÔ∏è Railway Architecture - Correct Setup

## ‚úÖ **Yes, That's Exactly Right!**

In Railway, you should have **separate services** for different components. This is the correct and recommended architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è **Your Railway Project Should Have:**

### **1. PostgreSQL Service** (Database)

- **Purpose**: Stores your analytics data
- **Type**: Database service
- **What it provides**:
  - Database connection string (`DATABASE_URL`)
  - Persistent data storage
  - Database management

### **2. Web Service** (Your Streamlit App)

- **Purpose**: Runs your Streamlit application
- **Type**: Web service
- **What it provides**:
  - Your app URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`)
  - Streamlit interface
  - Connects to PostgreSQL service

## üîó **How They Connect:**

### **Database Connection Flow:**

```
Railway PostgreSQL Service
    ‚Üì (provides DATABASE_URL)
Railway Web Service (Streamlit App)
    ‚Üì (connects using DATABASE_URL)
Your Query Analytics Dashboard
```

### **Environment Variables Flow:**

1. **PostgreSQL Service** generates `DATABASE_URL`
2. **Web Service** uses `DATABASE_URL` to connect
3. **Your App** stores analytics data in PostgreSQL

## üìä **This Architecture Provides:**

### **‚úÖ Benefits:**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Database and app are independent
- **Scalability**: Can scale database and app separately
- **Reliability**: If app restarts, database data persists
- **Security**: Database credentials are managed by Railway
- **Backup**: Railway handles database backups automatically

### **‚úÖ Data Flow:**

1. User asks question in Streamlit app
2. App processes query using AWS Bedrock
3. App stores query in PostgreSQL service
4. App stores response in PostgreSQL service
5. User gives feedback ‚Üí stored in PostgreSQL service
6. Query Analytics dashboard reads from PostgreSQL service

## üîß **How to Set This Up Correctly:**

### **Step 1: PostgreSQL Service Setup**

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will create the service and provide `DATABASE_URL`
4. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` for later use

### **Step 2: Web Service Setup**

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New Service"
2. Select "GitHub Repo" ‚Üí Your repository
3. Railway will deploy your Streamlit app
4. Add environment variables including `DATABASE_URL`

### **Step 3: Environment Variables**

In your **Web Service** (not PostgreSQL service), add:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@containers-us-west-1.railway.app:5432/railway
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
BEDROCK_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID=your_kb_id
ADOBE_CLIENT_ID=your_adobe_client_id
ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_adobe_client_secret
ADOBE_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_adobe_org_id
```

## üéØ **Why This Architecture Works:**

### **1. Database Persistence**

- PostgreSQL service keeps your data even if web service restarts
- Analytics data is preserved across deployments
- Database is managed by Railway (backups, updates, etc.)

### **2. App Deployment**

- Web service runs your Streamlit app
- Connects to PostgreSQL using `DATABASE_URL`
- Can be redeployed without affecting database

### **3. Environment Variables**

- PostgreSQL service provides `DATABASE_URL`
- Web service uses `DATABASE_URL` to connect
- Other variables (AWS, Adobe) are app-specific

## üîç **How to Verify It's Working:**

### **1. Check PostgreSQL Service**

- Should show "Running" status
- Should have connection details
- Should provide `DATABASE_URL`

### **2. Check Web Service**

- Should show "Running" status
- Should have your app URL
- Should have all environment variables set

### **3. Test Connection**

- App should connect to PostgreSQL using `DATABASE_URL`
- Query Analytics should show data
- No "database configuration error" messages

## üö® **Common Issues:**

### **Issue 1: DATABASE_URL Not Set**

- **Problem**: Web service doesn't have `DATABASE_URL`
- **Solution**: Copy `DATABASE_URL` from PostgreSQL service to Web service variables

### **Issue 2: Services Not Connected**

- **Problem**: Web service can't reach PostgreSQL service
- **Solution**: Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correct and both services are running

### **Issue 3: Database Tables Missing**

- **Problem**: Tables not created in PostgreSQL
- **Solution**: Check Railway logs for `init_railway_db.py` execution

## üéâ **This is the Correct Setup!**

Having separate PostgreSQL and Web services is exactly how Railway is designed to work. This gives you:

- ‚úÖ **Reliable database** that persists data
- ‚úÖ **Scalable web app** that can be updated independently
- ‚úÖ **Managed infrastructure** by Railway
- ‚úÖ **Secure connections** between services

Your architecture is correct! The issue is likely just missing environment variables or database initialization. üéØ
