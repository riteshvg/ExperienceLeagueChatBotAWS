# 🚀 Railway Setup Complete Guide

## ✅ **Files Uploaded to GitHub**

I've uploaded all the necessary files to GitHub with your Railway PostgreSQL credentials:

### **📁 New Files Added:**

- `railway_create_tables.py` - Creates tables with your credentials
- `railway_startup.py` - Runs table creation and starts app
- `railway.env` - Environment variables template
- Updated `start.sh` - Uses new Railway startup script

## 🔧 **Railway Environment Variables Setup**

### **Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**

1. Visit [https://railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click on your project
3. Click on your **Web Service** (Streamlit app)

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables**

Go to "Variables" tab and add these variables:

```
RAILWAY_DATABASE_USER=postgres
RAILWAY_DATABASE_PASSWORD=eeEcTALmHMkWxbKGKIEHRnMmYSEjbTDE
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key_here
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
BEDROCK_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID=your_knowledge_base_id_here
ADOBE_CLIENT_ID=your_adobe_client_id_here
ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_adobe_client_secret_here
ADOBE_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_adobe_organization_id_here
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your_s3_bucket_name_here
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy Web Service**

1. Click "Deploy" in your Web Service
2. Railway will automatically run the table creation script
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## 🗄️ **What Happens Automatically**

### **1. Table Creation Script Runs**

- `railway_create_tables.py` executes automatically
- Creates all 4 required tables:
  - `user_queries` - Stores user questions
  - `ai_responses` - Stores AI responses
  - `user_feedback` - Stores user feedback
  - `query_sessions` - Stores session information

### **2. Indexes Created**

- Performance indexes for fast queries
- Session-based lookups
- Date-based filtering

### **3. Tables Tested**

- Insert operations tested
- Select operations tested
- Delete operations tested
- Full data flow verified

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **✅ Railway Logs Should Show:**

```
🚀 Railway Startup Script
🔧 Running table creation script...
✅ Database connection successful
✅ Tables created successfully
✅ Table operations working correctly
🚀 Starting Streamlit app...
```

### **✅ Query Analytics Should Work:**

- No "database configuration error" messages
- Queries are recorded and displayed
- Feedback system works
- Export functionality works

## 🧪 **Testing Your Setup**

### **1. Check Railway Logs**

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your Web Service
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click on latest deployment
5. Look for success messages

### **2. Test Your App**

1. Go to your app URL
2. Ask a question
3. Check Query Analytics tab
4. Verify query appears in dashboard

### **3. Test Database Connection**

```bash
# If you want to test locally
export RAILWAY_DATABASE_USER=postgres
export RAILWAY_DATABASE_PASSWORD=eeEcTALmHMkWxbKGKIEHRnMmYSEjbTDE
python railway_create_tables.py
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue 1: Tables Not Created**

- **Check**: Railway logs for table creation errors
- **Solution**: Verify database credentials are correct

### **Issue 2: App Not Starting**

- **Check**: Railway logs for startup errors
- **Solution**: Verify all environment variables are set

### **Issue 3: Query Analytics Still Not Working**

- **Check**: Railway logs for analytics initialization
- **Solution**: Verify DATABASE_URL is being constructed correctly

## 🎯 **Success Checklist**

- [ ] PostgreSQL service running in Railway
- [ ] Web Service environment variables set
- [ ] Web Service redeployed successfully
- [ ] Railway logs show table creation success
- [ ] App accessible at Railway URL
- [ ] Query Analytics tab shows data
- [ ] User queries are recorded
- [ ] Feedback system works

## 🚀 **What's Next**

1. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway Web Service
2. **Redeploy** your Web Service
3. **Check Logs** for successful table creation
4. **Test App** - ask questions and check analytics
5. **Verify** Query Analytics dashboard works

## 🎉 **Your Setup is Complete!**

The scripts are now on GitHub and will automatically:

- ✅ Create PostgreSQL tables with your credentials
- ✅ Set up indexes for performance
- ✅ Test all database operations
- ✅ Start your Streamlit app
- ✅ Enable Query Analytics functionality

Just set the environment variables in Railway and redeploy! 🚀
